# Elijah-s-SKO-CW

Well... This subject was interesting, to say the least. I hadn't touched coding since year 10 so it's been a while. However, I think Karen and Andy did a good job at introducing coding, it was fairly easy to get a hold of the very basics. But I do feel that we could have spent more time learning more coding of different things, the things that we were taught weren't as in depth of what was necessary for the major project and the SKO. I found myself using GitHub Copilot a lot. Considering the course that I am doing is about graphic design, coding as a subject is something really different so it was cool to see the way it could be integrated together. While I did learn quite a bit about coding during the semester, I have a feeling I'm going to forget it all by next year, I don't see myself using code for anything anytime soon. But maybe I'm wrong, maybe in the near future there's something that I realise I could use coding for and I'll be able to use my coding learnings for something outside of university. Thank you, Andy and Karen, for teaching us through the semester.
